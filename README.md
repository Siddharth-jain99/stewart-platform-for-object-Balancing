To run the model kindly follow the steps.

1. Use the "extract to" option to extract the .zip folder. This will ensure that the files will remain inside the folder named "Project 2 Team 11 R2020a"
2. Open the "execute_model_2020a.m" file
3. Run the file. It make take a few seconds as it will install a library.
4. If for some reason the simulation does not start, kindly stop and start the program.

Debugging - wont be necessary but just incase
- if the simulation does not run, install the plugin "Simscape Multibody Contact Forces Library" and add to path
